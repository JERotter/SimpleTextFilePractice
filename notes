1) During the first week of your apprenticeship, be sure to get your SEPTA HQ building and your city ID cards as soon as possible.

2) From my experience, the SEPTA building badge may get you through the turnstiles, but may not actually allow access to the 15th/18th floor. If that's the case, just return to the badge office and explain the issue. They will fix the problem promptly, but the upgrade may take up to an hour to fully process.

3) If possible, it's best not to drive if you need to visit the office as finding a parking spot can be quite a challenge. SEPTA and Uber are great options and are very reliable.

4) However, if you do need to drive into Center City, it's been brought to my attention that the parking lot above Trader Joe's is one of the best and most affordable options in the area.
